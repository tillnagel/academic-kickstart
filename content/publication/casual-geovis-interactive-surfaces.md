abstract = "One of the main characteristics of cities is the large amount of people moving around. These flows are reflected in all the subways dashing through the city. With our visualizations we want to give an impression of this pulse of the city. In this art show submission, we present Shanghai Metro Flow, which consists of an animation, and an accompanying infographic poster. The animation is composed of three scenes, each giving another perspective into the metro network. The static poster shows details on the subway lines. Each visualization combines established techniques with an highly aesthetic form in order to attract people to observe and dwell on different aspects of urban mobility."
